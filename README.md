Simple Habit Tracking App developed using ejs and mongoose. All the data stored in mongodb and can be edited easily. 
I have kept the styling very basic, and can be changed as per convenience and requirement.

You can select any week of any month of any year and select the options for it as yes, no or none.
The days selected with yes as considered as the day you want to do the habit and displays as a check icon,
days selected as no considered as the day you want to skip doing that habit and displays with a cross icon
the days not selected as yes or no and kept as none wont be displayed in the schedule page. 

You can easily edit any week schedule by selecting week option and re-selecting days, changes made will reflected instantly without reload

Add multiple habits to track like reading a book, going to the gym etc
Track each habit everyday. These are the 3 statuses of a habit:
Done (yes)- Mark the habit as done for a day
Not done(No) - Mark the habit as not done for a day
None - User did not take any action on a habit for a day
A view to show all current habits. Here give an add button where you can add a new habit to track. 

A view to display 7 days of each habit
Show today where user can mark todays habit
And show the previous 6 days and the status of that habit for each day
A user can toggle between the three (above mentioned) statuses of a habit i.e. I can change todayâ€™s status as done, not done or none anytime.
Also I should be able to change any of the previous days status i.e. I can change the status of a habit for yesterday, day before yesterday or any previous 6 days as well
